          This survey is a research study conducted by the George Washington University Privacy and Security Lab (GWUSEC).

Each participant must complete the test alone, and without consulting outside sources. 
          <br><em>Please note: only participants who answer every question correctly will be entered into to pool to earn the reward.</em>
